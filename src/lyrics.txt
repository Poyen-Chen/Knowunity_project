 Verse 1:
I'm logarithmic, my flow's exponential,
My bars elevate like a mathematical credential,
My lines go deep like a base ten sequential,
I'm on another level, my style's influential.

My graphs so smooth, no need for a pencil,
I solve equations, make it look confidential,
Got that log rhythm, it's so essential,
Numbers in my head, my mind's presidential.

Chorus:
Logarithms, we ain't the same,
My math game strong, ain't playing no games,
Exponentiation, that's my domain,
I'm the king of logs, ain't that insane?

Verse 2:
I'm logarithmic, in a league of my own,
My calculations sharp like a mathematical cone,
I spit math facts, straight off the dome,
My brain's a calculator, call it my throne.

I stay positive, no negatives in my zone,
I'm the logarithm master, on the microphone,
Got math in my DNA, it's fully grown,
When it comes to logs, I reign on the throne.

Outro:
Logarithms on top, no one can compete,
My math rap game, undeniable feat,
K-Dot of logs, I bring the heat,
In the world of numbers, I can't be beat.
