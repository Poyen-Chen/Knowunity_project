# Knowunity_project: Educational knowledge posted on instagram / tiktok video

Our idea is to build an app that helps people learn through rap music (or any kind of music). You just enter a topic, and the app uses AI to create catchy rap lyrics that explain the topic in a fun and easy way. Then it generates a human-like rap voice using ElevenLabs, adds background music to match the rhythm, and even creates subtitles automatically for the video. The final result is a cool educational rap video that makes learning more enjoyable and engaging — like mixing school with hip-hop.

## Workflow

1. **Input a Topic** – The user enters what they want to learn about.

2. **Generate Lyrics** – A language model writes educational rap lyrics based on the topic.

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** – ElevenLabs converts the lyrics into a rap-style voice.

4. **Generate Background Music** – AI generates beats that match the vocal rhythm.

5. **Sync Audio** – Vocals and beats are automatically aligned and mixed.

6. **Add Subtitles** – Subtitles are generated and synced with the audio.
